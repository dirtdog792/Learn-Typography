Step 21
Give your h1 element a class attribute set to bold. This will make the text bold again.

Step 22
Horizontal spacing between equally important elements can increase the readability of your text.

Wrap the text 2/3 cup (55g) in a span element.

Step 23
Now we can add the horizontal spacing using flex. In your p selector, add a display property set to flex and a justify-content property set to space-between.

Step 24
Wrap everything within the .label element in a new header element.

Step 25
Now update your h1 selector to be header h1 to specifically target your h1 element within your new header.

Step 26
Create a new div element below your header element, and give it a class attribute set to divider large.

Step 27
Create a new .large selector and give it a height property set to 10px. Also create an .large, .medium selector and set the background-color property to black.
