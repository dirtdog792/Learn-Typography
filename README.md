Step 21
Give your h1 element a class attribute set to bold. This will make the text bold again.
Step 22
Horizontal spacing between equally important elements can increase the readability of your text.
Wrap the text 2/3 cup (55g) in a span element.
Step 23
Now we can add the horizontal spacing using flex. In your p selector, add a display property set to flex and a justify-content property set to space-between.
Step 24
Wrap everything within the .label element in a new header element.
Step 25
Now update your h1 selector to be header h1 to specifically target your h1 element within your new header.
Step 26
Create a new div element below your header element, and give it a class attribute set to divider large.
Step 27
Create a new .large selector and give it a height property set to 10px. Also create an .large, .medium selector and set the background-color property to black.
Step 28
You may notice there is still a small border at the bottom of your .large element. To reset this, give your .large, .medium selector a border property set to 0.
Note: the medium(medium) class will be utilized later for the thinner bars of the nutrition label.
Step 29Passed
Create a new div below your .large element and give it a class attribute set to calories-info.
Step 30Passed
Within your .calories-info element, create a div element. Give that div element a class attribute set to left-container. Within the newly created div element, create a h2 element with the text Amount per serving. Give the h2 element a class attribute set to bold small-text.
Step 31Passed
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.
Create a .small-text selector and set the font-size to 0.85rem, which would calculate to roughly 13.6px (remember that you set your html to have a font-size of 16px).
Step 32
Create a .calories-info h2 selector and remove all margins.
Step 33
Below your .small-text element, create a new p element with the text Calories. Also below the .left-container element, create a new span element with the text 230.
Step 34
Create a new .calories-info selector and give it a display property set to flex. Also give it a justify-content property set to space-between and align-items property set to flex-end.
Step 35
Create a new .left-container p selector setting the top and bottom margin to -5px, and the left and right margin to -2px. Also set the font-size to 2em and font-weight to 700.
Step 36
Create a .calories-info span selector, set its font-size to 2.4em and font-weight to 700.
Typography is often more art than science. You may have to tweak things like alignment until it looks correct.
Give your .calories-info span selector a margin set to -7px -2px. This will shift your 230 text into place.
Step 37Passed
Typography is often more art than science. You may have to tweak things like alignment until it looks correct.
Give your .calories-info span selector a margin set to -7px -2px. This will shift your 230 text into place.
Step 38Passed
Below your .calories-info element, add a div with the class attribute set to divider medium.
Step 39
Create an .medium selector and give it a height property of 5px.
Step 40
Create a new div element below your .medium element. Give it a class attribute set to daily-value small-text. Within this new div, add a p element with the text % Daily Value *, and set the class attribute to bold right.
Step 41
The text % Daily Value * should be aligned to the right. Create a .right selector and use the justify-content property to do it.
Step 42
Use your existing .divider element as an example to add a new divider after the p element.
Step 43
After your last .divider element, create a p element and give it the text Total Fat 8g 10%. Wrap the text Total Fat in a span element with the class of bold. Wrap the text 10% in another span element with the class of bold. Finally, nest the Total Fat span element and the text 8g in an additional span element for alignment.
